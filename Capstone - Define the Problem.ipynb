If an accident happens, how should we determine the severity of it hence make the most efficient response?\n\nIt is important to forecast the severity of an accident to dispatch appropriate police forces and ambulances or even fire trucks to the scene. For example, if there are pileup car accidents involving multiple injuries, the insufficient number of ambulances might lose the best timing of saving lives. By providing the on-scene description of an accident by witnesses, the call center can use the model to predict the severity of the current one, therefore provide the best help in time."
